# ICS2O CPT

This is a culminating task in which students are required to demonstrate overall mastery of the course content and expectations. Students apply knowledge and skills in problem solving, programming, hardware, and networking, and demonstrate the ability to design, create, test, and debug computer programs.   

Most students choose to create a video game, but you may create a program that performs some useful task. Some suggestions:
- Cafeteria ordering app. 
- Calorie counting app 
- Mathematical Quiz game. 
- Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Function Graphing.
- Personal Finance App
- Trivia Game
- Stock Market Portfolio

## General Requirements
### Constant uploading to GitHub
Each member is required to post detailed commits on GitHub on a daily basis, after each small (successful) change. Remember, it is preferable that you edit the code from the GitHub editor, rather than dragging the file constantly to the window. When you edit and paste in your code, it keeps better track of the changes that were made.
*Each commit/upload must be [PEP8 compliant](http://pep8online.com/).*

### Issues
Occasionally, you will have some issues, please create an issue from your repository and assign it to a project.

## Deliverable #1
### Topic Proposal
By the midpoint of the second day, you should have a good idea of what type of program you want to create.

The topic must be cleared by Mr. Gallo before you continue. You will be required to come and pitch the idea to me in person. Be prepared to answer questions about what types of features (generally) your program will have. Fill out the appropriate form and then see me at any point during the first two days.

## Deliverable #2
### Storyboard
Come up with some hand-drawn sketches of various screens of your program. i.e., menus, the game as it is played.

### Repo-Project Setup
Your group is to setup a repository project with the following columns:
- To Do
  - Select the “To Do” preset and check the boxes for both “Move all newly added issues and pull requests here” and “Move all reopened issues and pull requests here”
- In Progress
- Roadblocks
  - You will move any topic that hit a roadblock and cannot progress.
- Done
  - Choose preset: Done, then check all three of the “Move all..” options.
*Here is an example of what the [project columns](https://github.com/MrGallo/CPT-ICS2O/projects/1) should look like.*

## Weekly development steps
On each monday, you will come up with a list of tasks that need to be completed for that week. These tasks will be updated in the Projects section of your GitHub repository.
